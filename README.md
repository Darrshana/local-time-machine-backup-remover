# local-time-machine-backup-remover
Removes the MacOS local backup to save up some storage space.
# Why this?
MacOS users usually run out of space. The many stringent methods like never storing the Entertainments folder out in external harddisks is temporary. This script provides the <b>last resort</b> to give you the final blocks of storage you can gulp down.
# How to use?
Download the zip file, extract the folder, chmod into the folder.
<br>
Run the following command which will ask your password as removing backups requires the root user access.
<br>
<br>
`sudo ./time-machine-backup-remover.command`
<br>
<br>
If you find this helpful share with other MacOS users in need of this piece if code.
<br>
<b>Have a great day :)</b>
